*Bridging the Gender Gap â€“ Empowering the Girl Child*

Educating and empowering women isn't just about equality, it's about progress. Together, let's bridge the gap and build a world where every girl has the opportunity to thrive.

This project is a heartfelt initiative by four girls who believe in change. Women across the world face barriers in education, employment, healthcare, and fundamental rights. Our platform is a small but significant step toward ensuring that every girl and woman receives the support, knowledge, and guidance she deserves.

## Main Features

1.  AI Chatbot for Female Feticide Awareness
Our AI-powered chatbot is designed to provide information, debunk myths, and raise awareness about the grave issue of female feticide. Through meaningful conversations, we aim to inspire change and educate individuals on the importance of gender equality.

2.  Myth-Busting Menstrual Health Quiz
Menstruation is natural, yet countless myths and taboos surround it. Our quiz is designed to help users distinguish facts from misconceptions, empowering them with knowledge.

3.  Fair Pay Checker for Women
Many women are underpaid for the same job as their male counterparts. Our tool helps female users determine if they are being paid fairly compared to market standards, promoting wage transparency.

4.  Mentorship, Scholarships & Career Guidance
Education and mentorship open doors to brighter futures. Our system recommends scholarships, career paths, and mentorship opportunities tailored to users' skills and interests, helping them break barriers in their professional journey.
