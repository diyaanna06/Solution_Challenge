*Bridging the Gender Gap â€“ Empowering the Girl Child*

This project is a heartfelt initiative by four girls who believe in change. Women across the world face barriers in education, employment, healthcare, and fundamental rights. Our platform is a small but significant step toward ensuring that every girl and woman receives the support, knowledge, and guidance she deserves.
