Bridging the Gender Gap – Empowering the Girl Child

Educating and empowering women isn't just about equality, it's about progress. Together, let's bridge the gap and build a world where every girl has the opportunity to thrive.

This project is a heartfelt initiative by four girls who believe in change. Women across the world face barriers in education, employment, healthcare, and fundamental rights. Our platform is a small but significant step toward ensuring that every girl and woman receives the support, knowledge, and guidance she deserves.

🌟 Main Features

Menstruation is natural, yet countless myths and taboos surround it. Our quiz is designed to help users distinguish facts from misconceptions, empowering them with knowledge.
